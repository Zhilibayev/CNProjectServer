This is a project for Computer Networks course. Aim of the project is to learn basic knowledge about networking. Task inside the project and called "CS233-Proj1.pdf". We did this task in pairs. Contributors: [Aidar Babanov](https://github.com/AidarBabanov) and [Serik Zhilibayev](https://github.com/Zhilibayev).   

We had to create P2P (Peer-to-Peer) aplication for sending files between two users (Similar to Napster). 

This is server side. Clients connect to it, search for necessary files and download from a user who has them. This part recieves requests and sends responses to client side.
